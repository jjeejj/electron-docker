## Issue and Pull Request Labels

This section lists the labels we use to help us track and manage issues and pull requests.

Please open an issue if you have suggestions for new labels.

| `question` | Questions more than bug reports or feature requests (e.g. how do I do X). |
| `feedback` | General feedback more than bug reports or feature requests. |
| `help-wanted` | The team would appreciate help from the community in resolving these issues. |
| `more-information-needed` | More information needs to be collected about these problems or feature requests (e.g. steps to reproduce). |
